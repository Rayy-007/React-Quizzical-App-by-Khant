# React Quizzical App

## Project Overview:
Quizzical App is a dynamic React application that challenges users with a variety of quizzes sourced from an external quiz API. The project showcases my proficiency in React, encompassing state management, props handling, and effective API data fetching.

API Integration: I gained hands-on experience in fetching data from an external API, ensuring efficient data flow within the application.
Challenging Logic: The quizzes provided opportunities to tackle complex logic and enhance problem-solving abilities.
How I Built It:
The application was built using React, leveraging the Create React App (CRA) setup for a streamlined development process. The state management and props handling were implemented meticulously to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. The integration of the quiz API involved careful consideration of data structures and handling asynchronous operations.
